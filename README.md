# reaction-diffusion

This program models the Gray-Scott Model of Reaction Diffusion in p5js.

## To Use
To use this program, download the files. There is an index.html file and a script.js file. All you need to do to run the program is open the index.html file in your browser of choice.
These are the values you can change to modify the parameters of the reaction:

| Variable Name | Variable Represents... | Line of Code |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| `dA`          | Diffusion rate of A    | 6            |
| `dB`          | Diffusion rate of B    | 8            |
| `f`           | Feed rate of A         | 10           |
| `k`           | Kill rate of B         | 12           |

You can also change the size of the canvas (`canvas_width` and `canvas_height`) and the size of the Chemical B Seed (`seed_size`).
